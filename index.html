<p>You can find all the labs from the menu below.</p>
<p>Some tasks are whitten on the page, but others are linked.</p>

      <h1>Lab 1</h1>

      <p>I didn't have much difficulties doing this lab.</p>

    <h3>Definitions</h3>
    <h5>HTML</h5>
		<p>It defines the content of the page, allows the page to be connected with the css and js docs</p>
	<h5>CSS</h5>
		<p>It defines the style of HTML document and specific elements</p>
	<h5>JavaScript</h5>
		<p>It defines the behavior of the webpage</p>
	<h5>HTTP</h5>
		<p>It is a protocol that translated HTML document to the suitable for the human eye view</p>
	<h5>HTML5</h5>
		<p>It is the last version of the HTML standard<p>
	<h5>Dynamic HTML (DHTML)</h5>
		<p>It changes the "static" HTML content while viewing and after loading</p>

      <h3>Coding conventions</h3>
		<p>I studied the coding conventions, understood the concept and importance of following them.</p>

      <a href="lab 1/task3.html"><h3>HTML5</h3></a>
      <p></p>

      <h3>Developer tools</h3>
		<p>I was already more or less familiar with these developer tools but reading about them and studying them made everything more clear.</p>

      <a href="lab 1/task5.html"><h3>Dynamic HTML</h3></a>
    </div>

    <div class="tab-pane" id="tab2">

       <h1>Lab 2</h1>
      <p>I already had some experience in working with responsive web design before though reading about it and studying different techniques gave me a better understanding and a more clear view on this technology.</p>

      <h3>RWD</h3>
      <h5>Examples and code review</h5>
      <p>Fluid grid:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Content overlaps with the change of the screen widths</li>
        <li>Logo illustration gets cropped under 800×600</li>
        <li>Image sizes get unreasonable</li>
        <li>Fluid grip works well for the desktops, but would bug a lot for any other devices</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Media query:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In some way the technology is implemented imperfectly</li>
        <li>Works well enough for different screen sizes and devices</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sizing (em, px, etc):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Allows to size things depending on the webpage characteristics</li>
        <li>Can be applied with media queries</li>
        <li>Works well a long as the size difference needed is not major</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>RWD examples</h3>

      <p></p>

      <a href="lab 2/task3.html"><h3>RWD in practice</h3></a>
      <p> After you have done the basic layout, how could you prevent user zooming the site on mobile?</p>
      <p>By adding this line of code: </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="code.png">
      </figure>

      <a href="lab 2/task4.html"><h3>Adding stuff</h3></a>
      <p>Figure elements are better to use in addition to the standard elements because its position is independent from the main document and other elements, and if it is removed it should not affect the rest.</p>

      <a href="lab 2/task5.html"><h3>Responsive person list</h3></a>
      <p></p>
    </div>

    <div class="tab-pane" id="tab3">
	<h1>Lab 3</h1>
  <p>Video and audio elements weren't difficult. WebSockets and Local Storage turned out to be a bit tricky at first, but very understandable after certain time spent studying and researching.</p>

      <h3><a href="lab 3/task1.html">Web Sockets</a></h3>
      <h5>What kind of problems web sockets solve?</h5>
      <p>They enable to send data to the client and the communication with the server and between servers</p>
      <h5>In what kind of situations you should use them?</h5>
      <p>In the application that include the situation that require the multiple users communicating with each other and if the user needs to get server-side data that keeps changing.</p>
      <p>Examples: multiplayer games, group editing, news updates.</p>
      

      <a href="lab 3/task2.html"><h3>Local Storage</h3></a>

            <h1>Lab 4</h1>
            <p>I studied canvas before, so I knew the basic structure and it wasn't that challenging, but I needed time to remember how to use canvas well. Also I got new skills and learned a lot while makimg the game and the guidance line.</p>

      <h3>Very simple draw application</h3>
      <a href="lab 4/task1.html"><h5>Without fancy guidance line</h5></a>

      <h1>Lab 5</h1>
      <p>JQuery was absolutely new thing to me, even though I used it befor a little bit I never studied it properly from the scratch so it was very nice to sort the information in my head properly. I read about Ajax before but I never used it so it was a completely new skill.</p>
      <h3>Getting familiar with jQuery</h3>
      <h5>What can you do with jQuery?</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>navigate a document</li>
        <li>select DOM elements</li>
        <li>create animations</li>
        <li>handle events</li>
        <li>develop Ajax applications</li>
        <li>create plug-ins on top of the JavaScript library</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>How it can help you as web developer?</h5>
      <p>It can make many development techniques easier and faster. It allows to include APIs and successfully work with them.</p>

      <h5>If you think our earlier participant list app, in what kind of issues you could use jQuery?</h5>
      <p>For getting the name from what the user wrote and for posting it.</p>

      <h5>What are CDNs? What kind of beneﬁts you get if you use them? </h5>
      <p>Content delivery network - it is a group of servers that are distributed geographically. It is mostly responsible for the faster data transfer, faster internet content loading and better availability. The popularity of this service continues to grow nowadays.</p>

      <h1>Lab 6</h1>
      <p>Flickr photo wall seemed very complecated and hard to make at first, but after going through the docimentation that was linked in the lab and spending some time for a research myself it turned out to be quite simple and very interesting. I thought it would be much harder and it will take a lot of time.</p>
